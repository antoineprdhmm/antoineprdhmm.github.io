Fabrice Éboué, a French comedian, wrote a well-known comedy sketch about social media.

The sketch revolves around a character named "Dédé," a common nickname for the drunk guy you find in every small-town bar in France, known for his nonsensical talk.

Before the advent of social media, each town's "Dédé" was confined to his local bar. His nonsensical chatter would entertain the other patrons, who enjoyed his comedic ramblings and would often buy him drinks.

With the rise of social media, however, one town's "Dédé" can now connect with another town's "Dédé." This has led to potential chaos, such as the formation of flat-earther Facebook groups.

In addition to "Dédé," villages also have students.

# **Were you a Normal or Popular Student in High School?**

In High school we all encountered various groups of people:

- Popular athletes
- The popular girls who gravitated around the popular sports guys
- The class brain

And many more.

Before social media, it was evident that these groups were the minority. As a typical student with average interests and abilities, you didn't feel out of place because you knew you were one of many.

Our standards for success and achievement were quite distinct back then.

I remember a classmate who spent a year bodybuilding and became impressively muscular. He was the school's version of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Yet, compared to the bodybuilders we see on social media today, his physique might appear less impressive.

Our standards were previously shaped by professional athletes on TV and those around us. Now, the issue is clear:

The people who gain significant attention on social media are often exceptional individuals, not average people.

- Instead of seeing a beginner guitarist struggling to learn new riffs, you find extraordinary guitarists doing mind-blowing solos.
- Rather than seeing an amateur runner with an imperfect technique, you see ultramarathoners effortlessly racing down mountains with GoPros on their heads.

All the exceptional talents from our high school days might be sharing content today, but they compete with other exceptional individuals from other schools. A bodybuilder who once amazed us might seem inadequate today due to the higher bar set by social media.

As we scroll through social media:

- An ordinary person could feel she’s bad at everything.
- A strong performance may appear unimpressive compared to the content we encounter online.

This can result in feelings of demotivation, even when individuals are performing well. It can also drive people to engage in activities they don't genuinely enjoy, simply to conform to the perceived norms on social media.

# Becoming an Ironman

I’m a cyclist (uh oh, I probably should have mentioned that earlier; some of you might dislike me now).

Not a commuter cyclist, but a road cyclist. I’ve been into cycling since childhood, and over the years, I’ve gotten quite good at it. Still, there’s a noticeable gap between my skills and those of the professionals.

This year, I decided to train for a half Ironman to mix things up and embrace new challenges.

I chose a half Ironman because I needed to learn how to run and swim properly. Also, a full Ironman is a completely different beast due to the sheer distances involved:

- Swimming: 3.8 km
- Cycling: 180 km
- Running: 42.2 km (a full marathon)

So naturally, I started following triathletes and watching Ironman reels on Instagram.

I was astonished to see people beginning their Ironman journey from scratch and attempting to complete one in just a few months (“A lot of people are doing it, so why can’t I, and in less time?”). Or people boasting about finishing an Ironman quickly with minimal training, while others put in much more effort and take longer.

**Let’s just focus about running here**

Sometimes I see reels of beginner runners in Instagram, carrying water bottles for a short run, like 5km. Most commenters joke about how unnecessary that is for such a short distance.

But 5km isn’t really a “short run.”

Finding precise statistics on running and triathlon is challenging.

According to Statista, 50 million Americans engage in some form of running activity, which includes all distances. ([Statista link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/190303/running-participants-in-the-us-since-2006/))

However, as distances increase, fewer people can run them.

Approximately 1 million people finish a marathon each year (this figure is derived from various sources found on Google).

An Ironman isn’t just about running a marathon. Completing an Ironman requires a high skill level in three sports and the ability to tackle long distances in each.

According to the Ironman website, 45 full-distance Ironman races are planned for the next year.

Assuming each event has around 2,000 participants, that means around 90,000 people complete an Ironman annually.

Given that the world’s population is around 8 billion, only about 0.00001125% of people complete an Ironman each year.

Meeting someone who has completed an Ironman is pretty rare.

Despite this, on social media platforms like Instagram, the perception is:

- If you’re a runner, you should be doing marathons; otherwise, you’re underachieving.
- Add some excitement to your life—do an Ironman, or you’re not challenging yourself enough. Oh, you did a 150 km bike ride? That’s nothing; you should be training for an Ironman.
- Completing a half Ironman is a major achievement and a significant challenge overall, but it can seem insignificant on social media due to all the focus on full Ironman content.

# **Woke, Anti-Capitalism, and LGBT+ Movements**

I'm not entirely sure how things stand in other countries, but in France, these movements appear to be largely driven by young people.

And, to some extent, I can understand why.

If I were in high school now and saw people with perfect bodies, wealth, and exceptional abilities across various disciplines on social networks, I might struggle with being the poor, thin guy trying to play guitar in a band, or participating in sports but not excelling.

These movements have gained traction in recent years, coinciding with the rise of platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

“Woke culture" is sometimes associated with the concept of "deconstruction culture", and involves challenging existing norms and power structures. It aims for equality not just in opportunities but also in outcomes. This can lead to resentment toward those who excel in certain areas, as it may make others feel inferior.

I think woke culture is a reaction from average or below-average individuals to what they see on social media today.

These young people distinguish themselves with their colorful hairstyles, unique fashion choices, and active involvement in street protests. They maintain a strong presence on social media, where they are often outspoken and highly visible.

This is a way for them to get attention.

When it comes to LGBT+ movements, I believe there's more going on than just a focus on sexuality. Being different can attract attention. It allows average individuals to stand out.

Thinking back to the gay individuals I knew in high school or who are around my age now, many of them don't seem to be involved in today's LGBT+ movement.

I know these movements might encompass more than that. But I'm convinced that much of their impact stems from the influence of social media on young people today.
