Tracking your trades across multiple brokers is frustrating—and spreadsheets are a nightmare to maintain. PNLParse makes it effortless.  

Brokers make it easy to trade—but not to understand your results. If you use multiple brokers, tracking everything manually becomes nearly impossible.  

## What is PNLParse?

PNLParse reads the transaction files you download from your brokers and provides detailed insights on your trades, along with portfolio performance metrics.  

No spreadsheets. No cloud uploads. Just clean, private analytics on your own computer.

## Privacy First

Most analytics tools are SaaS, which means your trading data leaves your computer.  

PNLParse runs **entirely offline**—your trades **never leave your machine**.
