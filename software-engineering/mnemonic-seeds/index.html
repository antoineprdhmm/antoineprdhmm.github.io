            <p>A blockchain account is just a <strong>private key</strong>, from which
<strong>public keys</strong> (addresses) are derived.</p>
<p>Suppose we are the owner of an account, and a NFT is owned by one
public address of this account. Then we are the owner of this NFT.</p>
<p>As we say, <strong>not your key, not your coins</strong>. So we better not
forgot our private key. Else, we’ll loose everything we own !</p>
<p>This is why <strong>mnemonic seeds</strong> are useful.</p>
<h2 id="mnemonic-seed">Mnemonic Seed</h2>
<p>A mnemonic seed is a way of representing a large, randomly generated
number as a sequence of words.</p>
<p>This sequence is usually 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words long. The words
are chosen from a predefined list, and the specific word chosen at
each position in the sequence is determined by the value of the
private key at that position.</p>
<p>To compute the mnemonic seed</p>
<ul>
<li>The private key is first converted into a binary representation</li>
<li>The binary representation is then divided into groups of 11 bits</li>
<li>Each group is used to index into the list of 2048 words to select
a specific word</li>
<li>The selected words are then concatenated to form the mnemonic
seed.</li>
</ul>
<p>See BIP-39 for more infos about mnemonic standard.</p>
<p>Here is the official english word list <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt</a></p>
<h2 id="concrete-example">Concrete Example</h2>
<p>Say the private key is <strong>0x4B6150645367566B5970337336763979</strong></p>
<p>The binary representation of this private key is</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>01001011011 00001010100 00011001000 10100110110 01110101011
</span><span>00110101101 01100101110 00000110011 01110011001 10110011101
</span><span>10001110010 1111001
</span></code></pre>
<p>The list contains 2048 words. Each word is encoded on 11 bits. The
private key is encoded on 128 bits. 128/11 is not even, so we can’t
represent the private key like this into words.</p>
<p>We need to add 4 more bits, because 132/11 is even (12). These 4 bits
are the 4 leftmost bits of the SHA 256 checksum of the private key.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>SHA256(4B6150645367566B5970337336763979) = 81339e3d40865082004a0eccf5aba7d15a05d5d99a74547be4718b78f6da1617
</span></code></pre>
<p>1 digit in hexa is 4 digits in binary. The leftmost hexa char is 8,
which is 1000 in binary</p>
<p>The 132 bits are</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>01001011011 00001010100 00011001000 10100110110 01110101011
</span><span>00110101101 01100101110 00000110011 01110011001 10110011101
</span><span>10001110010 11110011000
</span></code></pre>
<p>In decimal it's</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>603, 84, 200, 1334, 939, 429, 814, 51, 921, 1437, 1138, 1944
</span></code></pre>
<p>The indexes for the 2048 words are 0 to 2047. So 603 means we look for
the 604th word in the list, which is <strong>enter</strong>.</p>
<p>Repeat for each, and we get the mnemonic seed !</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>enter appear boil plug install cup grape all industry recipe mixture vessel

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Private keys are long strings of random characters that are difficult
to remember, read, and write for humans. It’s easy to make a mistake
by copying the private key, and therefore, loose access the your
account.</p>
<p>Mnemonic seeds are a way to represent a private key in a form that is
easier for humans to remember, because it’s made up of words.</p>
<p>With a deterministic wallet, the original seed is enough to recover
all private and public keys. A few words sequence is the only thing to
remember.</p>
